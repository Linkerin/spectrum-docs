Welcome to Spectrum, a lightweight JavaScript / TypeScript library designed to simplify color manipulation and conversion tasks within the `RGB`, `HSL`, and `HEX` color spaces.

It may be not the most extensive library out there, but it's precisely what you need for common color-related tasks. Whether you want to blend two colors, get a darker version of your color, or the saturation of a HEX color value. Spectrum is your finely-tuned instrument for simplifying these processes.

### Key Features

- **Color values conversion**: convert color values within HEX, HSL, and RGB color spaces.
- **Effortless color mixing**: combine two colors with ease.
- **Color paramenters adjustments**: lightness, saturation, opacity, and more.
- **Color Inversion**: get a negative color of the given one.
- **Color Palette Generation:** create a color palette with varying lightness levels, all derived from a single base color.

Spectrum is here to make your color-related tasks more efficient and straightforward. In this documentation, we'll explore how to leverage its capabilities. Let's dive in!
