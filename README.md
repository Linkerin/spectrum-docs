## What is Spectrum?

Spectrum is a lightweight JavaScript / TypeScript library designed to simplify color manipulation and conversion tasks
within the `RGB`, `HSL`, and `HEX` color spaces.

## Key Features

- **Color values conversion**: convert color values within HEX, HSL, and RGB color spaces.
- **Effortless color mixing**: combine two colors with ease.
- **Color paramenters adjustments**: lightness, saturation, opacity, and more.
- **Color Inversion**: get a negative color of the given one.
- **Color Palette Generation:** create a color palette with varying lightness levels, all derived from a single base color.
